# SpringMVCFilmCRUD

## Description
Film Findr was created to interact with the SDVID MySQL database & display its information in a simple & effective way. The user can search the database for films by ID or keyword. They can also edit a film, add a film, or delete a film that they have added.

The web site includes 5 main web pages: a home page, an add film page, an update film page, an individual film information page, & a keyword results page with list of matching films.

The films contain data such as ID, title, description, release year, language, length (in minutes), rating, genre, special features, a list of actors in the film, & additional details such as rental duration (in days), daily rental rate, & replacement cost.

Forms were created to eliminate input errors & buttons were added to navigate the web site & perform actions.

## Lessons Learned
We learned how to properly format input forms, using various types such as text, radio, & check boxes. We learned how to link pages within the site & perform actions with the FilmController through Mapping (Get, Post, & Request). We learned how to troubleshoot error stack traces & resolved several bugs or errors. We learned how to use the correct database calls (${call.data} format) & tested everything to make sure it all worked properly.
